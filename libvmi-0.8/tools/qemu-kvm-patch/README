This patch is required in order for LibVMI to access memory from a running KVM virtual 
machine.  To start, you need the source code for QEMU-KVM 0.14.0.

tar zxvf qemu-kvm-0.14.0.tar.gz
cd qemu-kvm-0.14.0
patch -p1 < ../kvm-physmem-access.patch
./configure
make
make install

At this point you should make any other changes necessary to ensure that your system 
used this newly installed version of qemu-kvm when running KVM virtual machines.  You
will then be able to access the memory of each running virtual machine using LibVMI.
